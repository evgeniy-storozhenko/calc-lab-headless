information.description = Sine of a number x. Argument is measured in radians. To calculate the sine an argument in degrees, use sind(x).
information.description.0 = Cosine of a number x. Argument is measured in radians. To calculate the cosine an argument in degrees, use cosd(x).
information.description.1 = Sine of a number x. Argument is measured in degrees. To calculate the sine an argument in radians, use sin(x).
information.description.2 = Cosine of a number x. Argument is measured in degrees. To calculate the cosine an argument in radians, use cos(x).
