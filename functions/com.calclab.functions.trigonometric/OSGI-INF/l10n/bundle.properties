information.description = Sine of a number x. Argument is measured in radians. To calculate the sine an argument in degrees, use sind(x).
information.description.0 = Cosine of a number x. Argument is measured in radians. To calculate the cosine an argument in degrees, use cosd(x).
information.description.1 = Sine of a number x. Argument is measured in degrees. To calculate the sine an argument in radians, use sin(x).
information.description.2 = Cosine of a number x. Argument is measured in degrees. To calculate the cosine an argument in radians, use cos(x).
information.description.3 = Cotangent of a number x. Argument is measured in radians. To calculate the cotangent an argument in degrees, use ctgd(x).
information.description.4 = Tangent of a number x. Argument is measured in degrees. To calculate the tangent an argument in radians, use tg(x).
information.description.5 = Cotangent of a number x. Argument is measured in degrees. To calculate the cotangent an argument in radians, use ctg(x).
information.description.6 = Tangent of a number x. Argument is measured in radians. To calculate the tangent an argument in degrees, use tgd(x).
